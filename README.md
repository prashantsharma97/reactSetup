## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prashantsharma97/reactSetup.git



### Tailwind CSS Setup Breakdown:
 - Install Tailwind CSS and required packages:
   - npm install -D tailwindcss@3

### Generate Tailwind configuration files:
 - npx tailwindcss init

### Configure Tailwind file tailwind.config.js

 /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
   content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
   theme: {
     extend: {},
   },
   plugins: [],
 }


1. **Install dependencies**: Tailwind CSS and PostCSS related dependencies are installed first.
2. **Generate configuration files**: Tailwindâ€™s `tailwind.config.js` is generated for customizing the configuration.
3. **Configure Tailwind**: The `tailwind.config.js` file is updated to point to your React files (so Tailwind knows which files to scan for class names).
4. **CSS setup**: The Tailwind directives are added to your main CSS file (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, and `@tailwind utilities;`), which allows you to use Tailwind's utility classes in your app.
5. **Run the app**: After setting everything up, you can start the React development server, and Tailwind CSS will be applied to your project.

Is this setup good to go for you?
